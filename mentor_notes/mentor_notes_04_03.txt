GameControl
 - Compile errors?
 - GameControl object needs to be saved to static variable.
 
Cave
 - Array out of bounds exception from getRoom call from GameLocations
 
HighScore
  - HighScoreFile.txt not found.
  - After fixing that retrievePlayers crashes...
  
GraphicalInterface
 - Still has its own main function. 
 - Looks better than last time. Play button seems to resize things instead of the Apply button
 
Other classes seem mostly unchanged...
