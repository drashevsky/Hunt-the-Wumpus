Nice work everyone! Looks like we have a functional game. I looked through all of the commits, and in general things are good. Some high level things I noticed:
 - Commit messages could use some work. I had to guess what some of them were about.
 - Some classes which are not TextUI are printing text output, which obviously won't worth with the GUI version. We should either have all classes check GUIMODE or have GraphicalInterface and TextUI implement the same interface. I can talk more about this in person if interested.
 
I tried play testing the game. In general it seems to work, except for the error I got at the end.

General Thought: It would be nice for debugging if we can take "debug" CLI commands to check the state of things. For example things like "print map" or "find wumpus" or "set arrows 10". This will be especially useful for debugging once the GUI is developed.   

Some issues I found:

Tells me I'm connected to room 0, but I can't move there.

Aside from 0, rooms only seem to be connected to 2 other rooms (map 1). Because of that there only seems to be two ways to go. I end up in room 27 with the pit and start over on repeat.

 - For the real GUI, you'll need to arrange rooms up/down/left/right in a sensible way to the player. How will that work with the (seemingly random) room numbers?

Sometimes it tells me I'm connected to room 0 twice.

Answering trivial with a non-letter is apparently incorrect. Confusing to mix letter/number inputs.

On second playthrough map 1 was different. Is that supposed to happen?

Hit this exception:
